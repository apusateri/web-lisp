	<body>
		This is the layout file used to render the HTML page.<br />
		Dynamic replacement is available within the layout, i.e.: <br />
		The result of (+ 4 6) is ~{ (+ 4 6) ~}<br />
		This is where we enter the "content" of the layout: <br />
		~{ body ~}
		<br />
		And then we can add more things in our layout afterwards
