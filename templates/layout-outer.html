		<h2>Layout HTML</h2>
		This is the layout file used to render the HTML page.<br />
		Dynamic replacement is available within the layout, i.e.: <br />
		The result of (+ 4 6) is ~{ (+ 4 6) ~}<br />
		This is where we enter the "content" of the layout: <hr />
		~{ body ~}
		<hr />
		And then we can add more things in our layout afterwards
		~{ (web-lisp:powered-by) ~}
	</body>
